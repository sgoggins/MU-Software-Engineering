# Assignment 11: Team Sprint 2 : Spring 2020 : CS4320/7320 Software Engineering

In team sprint 2, we want to familiarize you with how people are thinking about open source software metrics, and also how an open source project works by participating in one. Team Sprint 2 and Team Sprint 3 contain one task that you can complete in either sprint, which is participating in at least one CHAOSS Community or working group call. 

## Getting Started
1. [Listen to the CHAOSS Community Podcast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ik09yeqgeeo6tn6/19.-the-chaoss-podcast.mp3?dl=0)
2. Find a CHAOSS Community Working Group You are Interested in Participating in by a CHAOSS Community Call. Here are the available calls in the next two weeks.  Your name will need to show up in the participant list, even if all you do is listen, it will give you an idea how things actually get done in open source software. All of these calls are on *this* zoom channel: https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288

3. Fork a CHAOSS Metrics Working Group Repository and develop a draft of a new metric. There is a full list of candidate metrics here. [Some are released, some are not, but there is a *tab* for each of the **five main working groups**.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oglcfYfvBX0mRNA_KgjpcgkRp8_ksx2q_n7a9V0Z9ZM/edit?usp=sharing) 
4. FIVE MAIN WORKING GROUPS GitHub Pages
    - [Evolution Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution)
    - [Diversity and Inclusion Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion)
    - [Value Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value)
    - [Risk Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk)
    - [Common Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-common)
4. Commit the draft metric you developed to your fork of a working group's repository. 
5. Submit a URL of your working group fork. 
6. Submit your own repository with an "assignment-11.md" page in an "assignment-11" folder, which includes which working group you plan to attend or participate in from the list above, and your own reflections on the podcast.
7. If you want to work ahead, you can read [8 Observations and 24 Questions about Open Source](../readings/24Questions.pdf) and [An Augur Systems Paper](../readings/augur_paper.pdf)
