## Answering the Question: Why Open Source? 
1. Why Participate in Open Source?
    - Sometimes its a job you get paid for because your company relies on an open source project.
    - Sometimes its to learn a new language. Most people learn new computing languages more quickly by combining tutorials with actually making project contributions. 
2. What is CHAOSS About? Helping people who are managing open source projects or use open source projects understand how healthy and sustainability.  The CHAOSS project is about being on the periphery of a set of Open Source Projects and assessing them. 
3. Legal Part: Open Source Licensing, and why would I give my code away for free?

2. [A Guide to Contributing to Open Source Software](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/participating-open-source-communities/) 

### Open Source Licensing
1. [What are the common open source licenses, and what "fake" open source licenses are emerging?](https://opensource.org/licenses)

## Assignment
1. Complete any remaining activities from the previous sprints. 
2. Using Google, GitHub, and any other resources at your disposal, identify 1-3 "Single Sign On" (SS0) open source projects that you might use to create a login for an open source project you are interested in. Examples of popular SSO's include: 
    - OpenID Connect
    - OAuth
    - uPort
    - **Specific Project**: https://sailsjs.com/ and https://github.com/balderdashy/sails
    - **Specific Project**: https://www.ory.sh/hydra/ and https://github.com/ory/hydra
3. By reviewing tutorials, examples, README.md files, and documentation for one available SSO (it can be something not on the list above), decide how you will build a "Hello World" login from one of the SSO's.  It can be a "Mickey Mouse" login, where the user does not need to create an account. Get as far as you can, and submit what you complete (even if it doesn't work) under a "Sprint-4" folder in your repository. 
    - Be sure to include a README.md file explaining how to setup and run whatever you did get to work
    - Include a REFLECTION.md file that includes: 
        - A description of which projects you looked at
        - Why you chose the one you did
        - How far you got in making it work and 
        - What obstacles you encountered in the process
4. Submit a file called OPENSOURCE.md with your reflections on the articles about why one would participate in open source software and
5. Identify one or more open source software licenses you would prefer to use for an open source project you create, and why, in a document called LICENSE.md
